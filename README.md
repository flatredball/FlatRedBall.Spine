## Introduction

FlatRedBall.Spine provides the ability to load Spine files in code or in your FlatRedBall project through codegen. 

**FlatRedBall.Spine is currently under construction. Lots of things may change so use at your own risk for the time being**

## License

You must own a license to Spine to use this in your project. For more information see the Spine runtimes license here: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/4.1/spine-monogame/README.md 

TLDR:

You are the user, so you must own a Spine license:
> You can integrate the Spine Runtimes into your software free of charge, but users of your software must have their own Spine license.
